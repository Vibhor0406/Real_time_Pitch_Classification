# Pitch Classification

This project explores the use of machine learning to classify baseball pitch types based on speed, spin, and other characteristics. Inspired by how Major League Baseball (MLB) broadcasts display pitch types in real time, this project implements a one-model-per-pitcher approach to improve the accuracy of predictions.

## Context

Baseball pitches can vary significantly depending on the type of pitch thrown. While a pitcher's claim defines the pitch type, it is possible to infer the pitch type based on measurable characteristics like speed and spin.

To learn more about pitch types and how to identify them, you can explore these resources:
- [YouTube: How to Identify Baseball Pitches](https://www.youtube.com/)
- [Baseball Savant: Guess the Pitch Type](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/guess-the-pitch)

However, identifying pitches by sight alone can be tricky, due to varying camera angles:

MLB uses machine learning to classify pitch types, and this project aims to replicate that process using publicly available pitch-tracking data.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Develop machine learning models to classify pitch types based on the characteristics of each pitch.
- Implement a **one-model-per-pitcher** approach to improve classification accuracy by training individual models for each pitcher.
- Use tracking data (speed, spin rate, etc.) to predict pitch types in real time.

### Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather pitch data including speed, spin rate, and other features using publicly available MLB datasets.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, normalizing speed, spin rate, and other features to train the model effectively.
3. **Modeling**: Train a machine learning classifier for each pitcher using their historical pitch data. The models will include classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using accuracy and precision metrics on test datasets. Ensure that models generalize well for each pitcher's different pitch types.
5. **Deployment**: Create a system that can take in real-time pitch data and predict the pitch type instantly, simulating how MLB broadcasts work.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive exploration of the data.
- **MLFlow**: Tracking experiments and model performance (optional).
